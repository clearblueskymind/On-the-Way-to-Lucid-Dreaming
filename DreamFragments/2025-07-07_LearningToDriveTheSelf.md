## 🌀 Dream Fragment

I was riding in a strange hybrid vehicle — part motorcycle, part sports car. The accelerator was on handlebars, but I was seated like in a car. The front extended long and low, making it hard to see the road ahead. I had some trouble reaching the brakes, especially as I approached a stoplight or perhaps a train crossing. A barrier came down. I worried I wouldn’t be able to stop in time — but somehow, I did. When the barrier lifted, I continued forward in this unusual but very cool vehicle. Still, I felt uneasy about the brakes, unsure I could stop if I needed to.

## 🌿 Reflection

A dream of momentum, control, and unfamiliar power. The vehicle seems to mirror the self — shaped partly for speed, partly for structure, not entirely within comfort. The struggle to brake may point to the practice of pacing, pausing, and trusting. There is movement, but also caution.

This fragment feels like an image of navigating life with ME/CFS — powerful dreams and ideas, but with necessary limits. The soul says: **you did not crash**. You stopped in time. The path is strange, yes, but you're learning to steer it.

## 🔮 Whisper from the Soul

*“You Are Learning to Steer the New”*

You ride a shape not seen before—  
part fire, part form, part something more.  
It answers touch, it hums with grace,  
but asks you still to find your pace.

You did not crash. You found your way.  
You stopped before the light gave way.  
You ride a dream both strange and bright—  
a steed of power, shadow, light.
